12- Intro to Spring Boot
    EJB - enterprise java beans (XML hell)

    Slide 4 -

        In Spring 3 java based config was started seen, until now there wer lot of XML.
        with Spring 5, we saw reactive programming.

    Slide 7 - major components of spring.


13 - Overview of application to be built
    slide 3 - Database operations will be handled by Spring data JPA repository.
    So we you'll see that we write the repository interface.
    Actually the implementation is provided by Spring Data JPA.
    this dotted framework will be generated for us.
    database will be handled by hibernate which implements the JPA standard.

    slide 4 - 
        we create packages for - these 4.
        services we typicaly write as interface and create implementation later for dependency
        injection to be writing to an interface.

        we dnt do MVC controller in interface because we dnt need to perform depednecy injection on them.
        However services it's very common to write multiple implementations of services.
        So we will follow that design pattern inside this course.

        And then repositories you'll see coming up in the course. You provide an interface for the repository
        and Spring Data JPA will generate the implementation.

         we will have a package called domain.And within that package we will create POJOs plain old Java objects
         which are just objects with properties and getters and setters, and we will configure those to be JPA entities 
         that JPA /Hibernate will use for persistence operations.
