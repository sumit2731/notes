web server, used for -
    reverse proxying (figure 2)
    load balancing  (figure 3)
    caching

why use nginx -
    a)load balancing.
    b)when we have multiple servers we do not need to encrypt all servers, we just need
        to encrypt one. figure 4.

install nginx -
    brew install nginx
    
    It creates a nginx directory  in -
        usr/local/rtc/nginx (in course)
        /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx(actual)

    Important files -
        /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Starting nginx -
    nginx

    go to - localhost:8080

Terminologies -
    directives - key-value pair
    context - you can create context using {}, within these you can directives for that
        specific context.

created new nginx.conf file. served a static html.
added a css file, styles were not applied.  in response header-
    Content-Type: text/plain (it should text/css)
    then we added types context inside http and told that for this type of files, this should
        be ContentType. then we included already defined types in using include.

added location block
    root inside location
    alias inside location block
    try_files directive
    using regular exprssion in location file
    redirect
    rewrite - matching via regex and then using that while specifying target

As LoadBalancer -
