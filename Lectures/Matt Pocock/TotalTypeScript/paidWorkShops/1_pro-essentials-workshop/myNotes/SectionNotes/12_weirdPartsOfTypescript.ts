/**
 *154.6 - here we saw how to use Object.keys
 */

/**
 *
 *
 * 150 - see lecture.empty objects anything except null or undefined.
 *  empty objects represents anything which is not null or undefined.
 *  It represents anything with 0 or more properties.
 *
 * 151 - proper typing of object with no property
 *
 * 152, 153 - excess property check
 *
 * 154 - Reason for why object.keys is typed as string
 *
 * 154.8 - evloving any, just see the code
 *
 * 154.9 - evolving any for arrays
 *
 * 155 - function does need to provide all argumnets when implementing it.
 *  but while calling it needs to provide all
 *
 * 156 - function parameters objects can have extra properties can required.
 * so when calling a function type which is union of functions types, parameter type  needs
 * to be intersection of all parameter types.
 *
 * 157 - when you have functions with incompatible type signatures being union together, you're
 * sometimes going to need to use as never in these situations to get yourself out of a bit of bother.
 *
 * 158 - When we have union of function, parameter types intersect togather and return types union
 * togather
