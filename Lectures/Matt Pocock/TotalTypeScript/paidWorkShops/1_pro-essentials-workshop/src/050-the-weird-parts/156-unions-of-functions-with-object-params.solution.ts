 * to be union of all individual types), but when called both union types are mushed togather(now
 * its single function whose argument type is intersection of individual argument types)
 * the union of function is turned into one function with one call signature that says its a
 * function which takes in object with properties - id and name (again this is because of reason 1).
 *
 * when we call this function now, it has to be a function that contains all of the
 * possibilities of things being passed into it. that means obj type needs not to be union of all
 * individual function types but intersection.
