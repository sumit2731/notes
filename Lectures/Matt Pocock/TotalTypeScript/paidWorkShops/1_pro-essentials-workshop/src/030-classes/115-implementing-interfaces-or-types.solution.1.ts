 * note teh naming convention here, for Shape class we have IShape interface
 *
 *
 * interface mentions the things that need to be present in public api of class.
 * you cannot mention private properties here.
 *
 * class can implement both interface as well as type.
 *
 * class can be use a type also, for example we can define function which receives a paremeter fo type class.
 * define interface like this can be helpful when we want to have ISquare, ICircle etc and they need to
 * have a common API
