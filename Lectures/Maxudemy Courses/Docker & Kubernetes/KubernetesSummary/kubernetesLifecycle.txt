In imperataive approach,by default kubernetes will only fetch the image when image tag is changed.
 so if you update image and push it. kubernetes will download it again because it already has this image

Also in each update(image update for ex), old container is shut down and new container is created.
but old container is not shutdown until new container is live.you see status of last update by using
rollout command.

1)When application crashes -
    pod is restarted.
    but a new container is created.

1)when deployment.yaml is updated(image is updated, configmaps is updated) -
    container is destroyed
    pod is destroyed
2)When container shuts down(/error) -
    pod is restarted, volume is preserved
    container is destroyed
