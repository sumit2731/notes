kebectrl - It is install on local system , it talks with cluster. it gives commands to master node, which then gets things done by worker
    node.

    installation -
        brew install kubectl

    commands -
        1)Deployments -
            1)kubectl create deployment "nameOfDeployment"
                creates a deployment object with a given name and sends it to masterNode of cluster.
                a)image - images to be used in container.
                    kubectl create deployment "nameOfDeployment" --image="name OfImage"
                    you can also use multiple images -
                    kubectl create deployment "nameOfDeployment" --image="i1,i2,i3"

            2)kubectl get deployments 
                we can see how many deployments we have in our cluster to which we connected here. 
            3)kubectl expose deployment "nameOfDeployment" --port=1000 --type=LoadBalancer
                exposes the pod,created by a deployment by creating a service.

                kubectl expose deployment first-app
                    a)--port = port that will be exposed from container (lecture 190)

                    b)--type = type of service that we want to create, different types are - (lecture 190)
                    
                        a)ClusterIP - default type. This means it will only be reachable from inside the cluster.Still, we will then at 
                            least get an address which doesn't change.

                        b)NodePort - which actually means this deployment should be exposed with help off the IP address of the worker node
                            on which it's running.this then will be accessible from outside.

                        c)LoadBalancer -Now LoadBalancer utilizes a LoadBalancer which has to exist in the infrastructure on which our cluster
                            runs.And then this LoadBalancer will actually generate a unique address for this service.it will also evenly 
                            distribute incoming traffic across all pods, which are part of this service.Now LoadBalancer, this type here
                            is only available if your cluster and the infrastructure on which the cluster runs supports it.AWS does, for 
                            example, and minikube thankfully also does it. so this command we can use in minikube.

                    ex - kubectl expose deployment first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
            4)kubectl scale deployment/"nameOfDeployment"
                It scales the no of pods present n deployment.
                options -
                    a)replicas - it means how many instances for pod you want to have.

                ex - kubectl scale deployment/first-app --replicas=3

            5)kubectl set image deployments/"name of deployment" containerName="new image name"

                This replaces the image in container of given deployment with new image.by default kubernetes will downloaded new image only if
                tag of image is changed. so change the tag. there are ways to override this.if image name is changed kubernetes  will download
                your iage and restart the container based on that.

                Verify in dashboard -

                    dashboard -> pods -> yourPod -> events (should see events for pulling new image, creating/starting container)
                    dashboard -> pods -> yourPod -> image (should see new image)

                Note - this kills the existing pods and starts new one

            6)rollouts -
                a)Status of last rollout -

                    kubectl rollout status deployment/"name of deployment"

                    output - 
                        prints the status of rollout. 
                        this to check whether last deployment or update to last deployment was successful or not.
                        This is either a success message, failure message or waiting message


                b)to see rollout history -

                    kubectl rollout history deployment/"nameOfDeployment"
                    here you will not see revision which is currently deployed.

                c)to get details of particular rollout of particular deployment -

                    kubectl rollout history deployment/first-app --revision="identifier"

                    identifier we get from last command.here we will get details like which image was used.
            
                d)how to go back to previous deployment -
                    kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app
                    By default reverts the last deployment and takes to version before that.
                    options -
                        a)--to-revision - takes user back to specific version.
                            kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app --to-revision="revisionTag"
                            kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app --to-revision=2
    

        2)pods - 
            1)kubectl get pods
                we will see pods created by our deployments.



        3)kubectl apply
            We can create file describing how kubernetes objects should be created, then then we can send these file to cluster(master node)
            using this command.

            flags -
                a)-f
                    kubectl apply -f="pathToFile"        
                    kubectl apply -f=deployment.yaml

                    if you have multiples files to be applied then you can use multiple -f f;lags.       

        4)kubectl delete  -
            a)deleting objects by name - 
                kubectl delete deployment "nameOfDeployment"
            b)deleting resources created by file - 
                kubectl delete -f=deployment.yaml
                kubectl delete -f=deployment.yaml,services.yaml
                kubectl delete -f=deployment.yaml -f=services.yaml
            c)deleting by selectors(l stands for labels, here we mention labels for objects to be deleted) -
                kubectl delete -l
        1)kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
                returns the info about cluster. context is name of cluster created by kind.

    a)pods
