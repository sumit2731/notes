Minikube - sets the dummy cluster locally.it will use a virtual machine on your machine, to create the cluster in there.So it simulates another machine on your machine by
    using such a virtual machine and the this virtual machine then holds this cluster.It will actually create a single node cluster which means there the worker and master
    node is combined into one single virtual machine.

    installation -
        brew install minikube
    commands -
        minikube start --driver=docker
            driver is the hyperwise you use, I am using docker. max used hyopervisor, but that needs to be installed separately.
            This creates the kubernetes cluster.
        minikube status - 
            to check whether cluster is running or not
        minikube dashboard -
            brings up web dashboard of our cluster.
            shows the Ui in browser
        minikube delete --all -
            deletes all minikube clusters
        minikube service "nameOfService" (lecture 190)
            When we create kubernetes service we do not external IP in minikube,so this is workaround of it.
            this will give us access to the service by basically mapping a special port to an IP which we can reach from our local 
            machine,and which identifies this virtual machine running on our local machine. so we can reach the service via this IP.
