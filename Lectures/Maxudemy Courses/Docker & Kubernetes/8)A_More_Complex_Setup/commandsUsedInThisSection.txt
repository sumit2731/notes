code 1 -
    a)creating laravel project using composer utility container -
        docker-compose run --rm composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel:^8.0 .
    b)bring app containers up -
        docker-compose up -d server php mysql
    c)running only one container(reset services are automatically started) -
        docker-compose up -d  server
    d)building images each time -
        docker-compose up -d --build server
            This rebuilds the image before running. which is good if something is changed.
            If nothing changed because of that layer concept in images and because layers are cached,
            it will of course not rebuild the image. It will effectively not rebuild anything,
            it will just reuse these cached layers.
    e)using artisan utility container -
        a)write some data into database
        docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate


    with this our dev setup is done, now we will see how to setup prod setup.
