RSC(new components0 render exclusively on the server. Their code isn't included in the JS 
bundle, and so they never hydrate or re-render.
This means that a big chunk of React's API is incompatible with Server Components.
For example, we can't use state, useEffect.

It also means that we have a bit more flexibility when it comes to the rules. 
For example, in traditional React, we need to put side effects inside a useEffect
callback or an event handler or something, so that they don't repeat on every render.
But if the component only runs once, we don't have to worry about that!


Normal components that we know are called Client Components, these render on client 
    and server.

Server Components. These new components render exclusively on the server. Their code isn't 
    included in the JS bundle, and so they never hydrate or re-render.
