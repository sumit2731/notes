8_Why python
    figure 1.

11_Get everything in Virtual Env
    Why we need vEnv it -
        See figure 2.

    creating virtual env(Way 1, mst common) -
        a)Navigate to folder -
            python3 -m venv <venv_name>
            python3 -m venv venv

            this creates a folder names venv folder.
        b)activate it -
            In mac -
                source .venv/bin/activate (we basically execute he script present in this folder, in same terminal session)

            Now you are not in your computers python, but in venv.
            in terminal you can see (env) before your username.
            This is where you can install and bring the third party modules.It will not affect anything that you are Bringing in one.

        c)deactivate it -
            deactivate

    Installing third party modules(you can be in venv or not) -
        a)way 1 -
            pip install <module_name>
        b)way 2 -
            mentions all modules in requirements.txt file.
            Then run -
                pip install -r requirements.txt

    It is always recommended to always work in venv.


12_Organize Python code like a pro
    see figure 3.
    normal python files are called modules.
    folder with __init__.py file is called package.
    see figure 4.
    ou cannot access something in someone else house, you need permission for that.
    this is called namespace and scope.


13 - PEP8 and Zen
    figure 5 -
        Pep8 is guidelines for writing better code
        https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
    ZEN -
        simple is better than complex.

        how get it -
            python3
            import this
