1)Human memory seems to have a “read-and-update” operation, wherein fetching a memory
    can both strengthen and modify it—a process known as reconsolidation.

    curious feature of human memory is “spreading activation.

    However, activation is not contained within one pathway. Some of the activation 
    energy spreads to other connected pathways
