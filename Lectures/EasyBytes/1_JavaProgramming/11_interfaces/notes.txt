248 - Intro to Interfaces
    Why interfaces ?
        so that we can write common code for functionalities and reuse that code for similar objects.
        for ex in slide, for different superheors, we have a common code for heros, so similar code,
        can be reused to use powers of heros.

    Why not solve the above problem with classes ?
        because with classes we need to define implementation.its like forcing devs to write a funtionality,
        when we want to overwrite it as subclass level.

249 - How to create a interface
    Inside interface we can define these -
        methods(By default all methods inside interface are public, so you can skip mentioning public access modifier) -
            abstract - ypu dnt need to specify abstract, as by default all methods are abstract
            default
            private - these can be static and non static.
            static

            access modifiers for methods -
                public
                private - These methods are only accessible from other default or private methods within the same interface.
                    implemeting classes cannot access or overwrite private methods.
                    private static - only other private static methods can access or call these.
                    private non-static - methods can be called by default methods.
        fields(By default all fields are public, static , final) -
            static
        Note -  
            we cannot define instant fields inside interface. 
            fields are always public
    interface(interface defined at top level, see chatGpt for nested intreface) can have only 2 access modifiers -
        a)default
        b)public

250 - Implementing Interface

    For methods defined in interface, classes can also define overloaded methods.

    interface can also inherit interface. In that case we need to use extends keyword.
    when class implements a interface, either it should implement all abstract methods inside interface.
        or class should be declared as abstract.
    use @Override when you are implementing a method define din interface.

252 - constant field declaration inside interface (slide 7-8)
    by default fields are - public, static and final.
    interface fields are always public, you cannot use any other access modifier with them.
    but if package is not public, then these fields wnt be accessible outside the package.

    Interface fields are always final.

    They are inherited by classes which implements them

    code - SuperHero.java, here we define field UNIVERSE_NAME


253 - Different method declarations allowed in interface (slide 9- 10)
    By default a method inside java is public and abstract


254 - why we need default methods in interface (slide 11)
    why default method?
        whenever a new feature want to be introduced inside an existing interface, instead of creating the method as an abstract method,
        they are going to create a default method with some default business logic inside it.


255 - How to built default methods in Interfaces (slide 12-13)
    default methods -
        default method in interface cannot be static.
        code - trackLiveLocation inside Superhero.java

    private methods -
        when Java team decided to allow the default methods inside Java 8.They end up writing a lot of default method in many of the
        interfaces.When a developer is writing a lot of default methods, which is going to have a lot of business logic,
        at some point of time, they are going to hold some common business functionality, which needed by multiple default methods inside
        the same interface.So to avoid that repetition of the business logic in multiple default methods, Java team provided a
        flexibility to define private methods in interface from Java 9.

        whatever private methods that you are going to define inside your interface, they are not going to be inherited by your implementation
        classes.These private methods are strictly for your default methods common business logic.
