String
StringBuilder
    This is mutable, so Prefered when we have large strings and frequent updates are needed.
StringBuffer
    same as String builder but it is safe for multi threading
CharArray
CharArrayWriter
    CharArrayWriter uses an internal char[] buffer, which is mutable.
    The buffer can grow dynamically
    CharArrayWriter is a Writer subclass, designed to work seamlessly with Java's character 
        streams. This makes it ideal for capturing output from other stream-based operations.
    The writeTo(Writer out) method allows you to efficiently write the contents of the CharArrayWriter
        to another Writer without creating an intermediate String object. This can be beneficial when 
        you want to process the character data further using other stream operations.
    Prefered over String when we have large Characters and frequent updates are needed.
    When to use -
        a)CharArrayWriter is primarily designed as a character stream for capturing output. 
            It's not as versatile for general string manipulation as StringBuilder.
        b)It's main focus is to be a destination for character streams, and then to provide
            the stored data as a char array, or String.
        c)CharArrayWriter is for capturing character output from streams into an in memory buffer.
