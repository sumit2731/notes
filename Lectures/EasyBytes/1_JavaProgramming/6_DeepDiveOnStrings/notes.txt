105 - Intro to String Pool (slide 1)
    String is refrence data type.

106 - Demo of String Pool in Java
    StringPoolDemo.java
    hashCode -  based upon the content that you are trying to store inside your object?
        This hash code value is going to be calculated.


122 - Joiniing Strings
    String.join() - How does join methid accept variable no of arguments?
    Whenever we are using these join() static method inside our Java programs behind the scenes, it is 
    going to leverage the StringBuilder class, which is present inside the string ecosystem, to 
    concatenate various multiple strings into a single string.
    
    So with the help of StringBuilder, only the join() is going to perform this joining operation very
    efficiently.StringBuilder is a class inside the string ecosystem, which we are going to discuss in
    the coming lectures. With the help of this class, we can overcome the challenges of String 
    immutability.We know strings are immutable in nature for some reason if you want to make them 
    mutable, then instead of String, we can use the classes like StringBuffer and StringBuilder.

    Also when we looked at definition of join method, we saw that we have class called CharSequence
     which is very similar to String.

     CharSequence - sequence of character, provides only readonly methods.Mutations methods can 
     be mutable or immutable, Character Sequence does not provide implementation of this.
        several classes like String,StringBuffer implement these.


124- System.out.printf()
    System.out.print() - pritnts the string
    System.out.println() - prints the string and moves cursor to next line
    System.out.printf() - formats the string, then prints the string on next line.
        to have cursor on next line use, '%n'



128 - Text Block in Java (Java 15) (slide 32)
    how to store string that are multi line without txt blocks -  TextBlockDemo.java
    by using TextBlock enter and tab buttons are also accounted for.
