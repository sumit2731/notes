272 - Copying Array using arraycopy and copyof

    System.arraycopy
    Arrays.copyOf(OrignalArray, length)
        This method is overloaded, see a implementation where we want our destination array of a different type
        See general version of copy of methiod and see how yu can create array of classes at run time
    Arrays.copyofRange(orignalArray,fromIndex, toIndex)
        Similar to copy but let us start copy from custom position
        fromIndex is included
        toIndex is not included
