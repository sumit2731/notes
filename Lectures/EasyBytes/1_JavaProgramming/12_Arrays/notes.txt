272 - Copying Array using arraycopy and copyof (slide 13-16)

    System.arraycopy(sourceArray, sourceStartPosition, destinationArray, destinationStartPosition, lengthToBeCopied)
    Arrays.copyOf(OrignalArray, length)
        copy always starts from 0.
        This method is overloaded, see a implementation where we want our destination array to be of a different type
        See general version of copy of method and see how you can create array of classes at run time
    Arrays.copyofRange(orignalArray,fromIndex, toIndex)
        Similar to copy but let us start copy from custom position
        fromIndex is included
        toIndex is not included

273 - Converting Ararys(slide 18)
    Array methods - java.utils.Arrays
        toString() - we can quickly check the content of array (int arrays prints tgis - [1,2,3])
        toList()
        toStream()

    otherMethods -
        binarySearch - searches a element after sorting
        compare
        copyOf
        copyOfRange
        fill - fills with a static value
        setAll -> initilizes the array elements with lambda
        parallelSort
        sort

274 - Sorting Arrays (slide 18)
    sort
    parallelSort(larger than 1,000) - sorts array parallely by using all cores.

    for sorting for custom data types we need to complete - Collections, lambdas and Functional Programming.
