            final int value = 10;
            static final double PI = 3.14159;
        b)make a method non-overideable -
            final void show() {}
        c)using final with classes prevents that class to be inherited by any other class

            a)class will have abstract method (only abstract class can have abstract methods)
            b)you cannot create instances from this class

            public abstract class className {}
        b)can be used in method to indicate the this is abstrcat method, it will
            not have any definition, child class needs to implement it. we will
            just provide signature here.

            public abstract void methodName();

MarkerInterfaces - they act as a "marker" or a signal to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or other Java code that a class possesses
    a certain characteristic or should be treated in a particular way. 3 marker Interfaces -
        a)java.io.Serializable
        b)java.lang.Cloneable
        c)java.rmi.Remote
