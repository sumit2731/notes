JDK -
    Installing- 

        Mac Install -
            a)Install SDK version - Follow page
            b)Install jdk using sdk man -
                a)sdk list java - shows the list of options, if we want to install java.
                    copy the identifuier for version, which you wantt use.
                    press q to exit list.
                b)sdk install java <identifier>
                    sdk install java 17.0.12-oracle
                c)sdk use java  <version>
                    sdk use java 17.0.12-oracle
                    
                    The default JDK is the version SDKMAN will activate every time you open a new terminal.
                    Without a default, youâ€™d have to run sdk use java <version> every time you start a new session.
                    Setting it via sdk default java <version> makes sure tools like IntelliJ, Maven, Gradle pick it up correctly through $JAVA_HOME.
                c)check version of java - java --version

        Windows -
            a)download jsk installer.
            b)install it.
            c)run - java --version
            d)if last command is not success, adda system variable named JAVA_HOME, value should be folder in which hdk is installed.
                It should be added automatically, if not add it.


    Chnaging jdk version -

        command -
            a)See all versions - 
                sdk list java
                for local versions - In Status column, look for local only
            b)switch version -
                this chneages the defult jdk version
                sdk default java version_name
            c)checking what JAVA_HOME points to -
                readlink -f "$JAVA_HOME"

    Env variables -
        a)JAVA_HOME
            windows - echo %JAVA_HOME% , echo $env:JAVA_HOME
            mac - echo $JAVA_HOME

            This should point to the root directory of your installed JDK (folder that has bin folder) - 
                /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home

        b)PATH -
            windows - echo %PATH% , echo $env:PATH
            mac - echo $PATH

            Your PATH should include the bin directory of the JDK (bin is also included) - 
                /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:...

        If you have installed sdk then both these paths will point to symlink - /.sdkman/candidates/java/
        If you to see where that symlink points -
            readlink -f ~/.sdkman/candidates/java/current

            or 

            realpath ~/.sdkman/candidates/java/current

    How JAVA path is resolved in mac -
        When you type java in your terminal, the /usr/bin/java wrapper likely calls /usr/libexec/java_home internally to get the 
        path to the "best" or currently selected JDK.That means even if path is not set you will be able to use  java comamnd.

        default path is - /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines

Maven -
    installation - 
        install maven.
    path variables -
        1)M2_HOME - /Users/sumeet.sood/myStuff/Softwares/apache-maven-3.9.11
        2)PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH

    YOu need to set this in 

    Variables -
        $PATH (till bin)
        $MAVEN_HOME (bin is not included)



        


After Chnaging these you also need to chnage at these places -
    1)In configs on intelliJ (On top right corner)
    2)File -> project Structure (cmd + ;)
