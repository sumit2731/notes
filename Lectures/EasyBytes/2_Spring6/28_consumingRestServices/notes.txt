218 - Introduction to consuming rest Services (slide 176)
    The reason why the spring team deprecated this RestTemplate is RestTemplate has certain limitations
    like it can't consume the REST services in an asynchronous mode.It will always consume the REST services
    in an synchronous mode.That means it is always blocking in nature and it can never run in a non-blocking
    style.
