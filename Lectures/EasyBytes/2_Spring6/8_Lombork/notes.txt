91- Intro To Lombork

    How this Lombok works is whenever we have Lombok inside our classpath and I'm using an annotations like @Getter 
    and @Setter on top of my model class.So what it will do is whenever I'm doing a build of my project,.class files
    will be generated.So during the compilation, Lombok will do all this magic.So it will pledge itself during the
    build process and it will auto generate the methods like getters and setters and it will make sure those methods
    are available inside the bytecode generated for your Java classes.So that's why as a developer, we can never see
    those methods inside our Java source files.But they will be present inside bytecode of class files, which will 
    not create any problems for us.


    Common annotations - 
        @data - generates everything

    Also we saw that in IntelliJ you check what kind of getters and setters will be created by Lombok by pressing cmd+f12.
        a)for final fields it will create constructor which accepts all params,
        b)for non final fields it will create geters and setters and o param constructor.

93 - @Slf4j
    It declares static logger method variable automatically.
    You can use it to prevent initializing logger method with wrong class.
     
    It is used in Project 21 - >HolidayController.java
