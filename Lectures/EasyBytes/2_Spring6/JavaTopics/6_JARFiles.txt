A normal JAR is just a zip file with:

    Your compiled .class files
    A META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file with an optional Main-Class entry

    ✅ To run a normal JAR:

        java -jar myapp.jar
    But this only works if: The myapp.jar has a valid Main-Class in MANIFEST.MF

    All external dependencies are manually provided via the classpath

Strucrure -

        myapp.jar
    ├── META-INF/
    │   └── MANIFEST.MF  (with Main-Class)
    └── com/example/Main.class

    It does not include any of its dependencies. You must handle those yourself.
