How JAVA path is resolved in mac -
    When you type java in your terminal, the /usr/bin/java wrapper likely calls /usr/libexec/java_home internally to get the 
    path to the "best" or currently selected JDK.That means even if path is not set you will be able to use  java comamnd.

    default path is - /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
