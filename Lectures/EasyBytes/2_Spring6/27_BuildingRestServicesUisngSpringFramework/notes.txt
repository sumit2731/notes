205_Intro to REST SERVICES using spring framework (slide 168)
    webServices - The very first one is using soap based web services.So soap based web services, they have a predefined
    schema defined and they strictly follow the XML style of communication.Since soap based web services are heavy in 
    nature these days, every developer is using REST based web services.The reason why everyone is liking and adopting
    the rest based web services is inside rest based web services.


    The reason why everyone is liking and adopting the rest based web services -
        a)is inside rest based web services.You don't need to have predefined schema or predefined contract between 
            the applications.That's one advantage.
        b)The other advantage with the rest based web services is the communication can happen in the format of
            XML or in the format of JSON.So there is no lock with XML.


206_Build REST services using SpringMVC styles & ResponseBody annotation (slide 169)

     @ResponseBody. - So whenever we are using this @ResponseBody annotation on top of the method we are telling
        to our DispatcherServlet saying that please do not send any view details as part of my response because
        the other application which is trying to consume my REST service, they just need a data, they don't
        need a view.



code -
    Project_45
    Files -
        projectSecurityConfig.java - Disabled csrf for /api, and enabled authentication for /api.
        ContractRestController.java
        models/Resonse
