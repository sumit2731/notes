what we done -
    a)First we created a database in AWS
        It was AWS RD  -> MySQL
        We made it public
        userName - admin, password - MYSQLSPRING
        Then in securityGroup - we added inbound groups to allow access from outside

    b)Then we downloaded the client - Sqlectron
        connected it to aws database by using endpoint and port from aws.
        then executed some scripts on that table to create tables and insert some data.
    c)Then we connected this table with spring boot application.
        a)From spring boot started form added mysql dependency, added it t pom.xml
        b)Updated application.properties with 3 things -
            spring.datasource.url
            spring.datasource.username
            spring.datasource.password
        c)From security config removed some exceptions related to H2 DB.
