13- Creating Maven Project
    we created a new Intellij Project, build option selected maven.
    Then we wen to this site - https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central
    copied maven coordinates of maven dependency and pasted in pom.xml.
    IntelliJ automatically downloaded these dependencies.
    You can see these dependencies on right hand side under maven, also on left hand side under "external dependencies".
    
    default path where maven downloads dependencies -  /Users/sumeet.sood/.m2/repository

    why this path, because in maven folder, dere is conf/settings.xml. it mentions tis isd default path.
    it also specifies the way to override it.

    then we saw how to open a existing maven project in Intelij.


14 - creating bean using @Bean Annotation(slide - 18)
    the very first are basic approach to create a spring bean is with the help of bean annotation on top of any Java method.
    Whenever we mention these annotation on top of any Java method, the return type from the method is going to be converted as 
    a spring bean and the same will be maintained by the spring context or spring IOC container.

    Here you may have a question like even inside the Java method also I'm using a new operator.
    Of course, that's a very valid question.This is the most basic approach.And when we want to create the bean very first time, 
    definitely we have to create with the help of new operator post that once my object is converted into a bean, my spring context will take care of
    autowiring, dependency injection, which we are going to discuss in the coming sections.

    But there are many other approaches also to create a bean.And in those approaches we don't even have to use the new operator.
