index.tsx
    post-list.tsx
        post-card.tsx

Problem - type of prop  of post-card post, component expects some extra props.api is returning that extra prop.
    similarly in in some other component we expect we expect Post plus some extra proeprties.`

solution -
    a)Add new properties to prop types of component using intersection.
        drawback -
            a)we need to make this change at wherever this prop types comes into component hierarchy. 
            b)which ever component is consuming this prop, we need to make change their also.

    b)if you ca get hold of type type returned by backend, directly use that type in component.if backend is node, then
        use RetunType<typeof function>.
        drawback -
            a)component is tied with API response, cannot be used to render other type of posts.


Problem - our component expects some different properties with posts type.
    see solution on figure 3.
