1)Single Responsibility Principle - One component should be responsible for 1 thing.
    Everything else should be delegated to other components.
2)
    Page Component - signInPageComponent
    Feature Component - handles a feature like signinForm handles the user signing into application.
        this means all code related to signin the user should go into this component and should be
        responsibility of this component.feature components are almost always made up of smaller UI components.
    UI Component - like applies some styles in container and renders the children. no logic, no state, no effects,
        no hooks.

3)Compound Component -
    A component is only rendered inside a another component, they use context to share state.

4)Extracting Things into hooks,even if they are not reuseable.
