Figure 3 -
    while executing java code, for each process a separate instnace of jvm created. so we can
    have multiple jvm instances, all these take memory from total memory allocated to JVM.
    each process can have multiple threads,figure shows which things are shred between threads
    and which are not.


    Registers - these are physical memory locations that CPU has, its fastest to access. 
    context switching - when cpu switches from 1 task to another. while switching it saves the register state
        is safely stored and new thread state is loaded into register. 


Multitask - different processes at same time.
Multi threads - different threads at same time.
