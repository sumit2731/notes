why 2 ways of creating threads? because if your are already extending a another class then you creating
    create thread by implementing the interface.

Generally prefer implementing Runnable interface.

    Thread LifeCycle. Once thread os terminated , it will not go back to running state.

    When thread gos to block state? when it needs to perform I/o operation or it is waiting to acquired lock on
    a object which is held by another thread.At any point of time, you can call stop method and terminate it.


    When thread goes to block state, it releases all the monitor locks it holds.

    Stop method is terminated


Monitor Lock(Figure 8)

    Every object in java has a monitor lock associated with it.when a thread wants to access a synchronized 
    method/block, it has to acquire the monitor lock of that object.
    if some other thread is holding the lock, then the current thread goes to block state until the lock is released.
    once the lock is released, one of the blocked threads will acquire the lock and enter the synchronized method/block.

    In case of class instance methods that monitor lock is placed on object, through which method is called.

    Also you can create synchronized block inside a method, in that case you can specify the object whose monitor 
    lock is to be acquired.
