Code - producer-consumer with buffer

Why these methods are deprecated -
    Stop - No lock is released
    Suspend - same as wait but lock is not released
    resume - used to invoke the therad which is in suspended state.


Daemon Thread -
    daemon - something whch is running in async manner.
    A thread which runs in background and does not prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes but the thread is still running.
    When all non-daemon threads finish, JVM terminates all daemon threads and exits.
    Example - Garbage Collector, JIT compiler etc.
    By default, threads are non-daemon.
    You can set a thread as daemon by calling setDaemon(true) method before starting the thread.
    You can check if a thread is daemon or not by calling isDaemon() method.
