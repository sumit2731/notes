why locking?
    we can access the code through any object but only 1 thread should be allowed to execute that code.
    their are 4 types of locks.
        1. Reentrant Lock
            see code
            Why this is called so, because a thread can acquire same lock any no. of times, but it must
            call unlock same amount of time to unlock it.
        2. Read Write Lock
            Shared lock - multiple thread can put shared(read) lock and read data.But if read/shared lock
                is present, no other thread can put exclusive(write) lock.
            exclusive lock - This lock can only be taken when their is no other lock(read or write) on this
            resource.

            when to use -
                When read is very high as compared to write.
            
            see code

            2 implementtaions -
                1. ReentrantReadWriteLock - non fair lock
                2. StampedLock - stampedLock.asReadWriteLock()
                    fair lock
                    it supports optimistic read lock.
                    
        3. Semaphore
        4. Stamped Lock
