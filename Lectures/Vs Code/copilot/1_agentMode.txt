        a)fetching docs -

            tech stack
            technologies to be used
            best practices(use LLM to generate such best practices)
        d)Now we need app to talk to DB servers -
            vs code can talk with different databases via MCP.
            MCP are little programs that you can download on your machine, they run on your machine and they know how to talks with things, like db.
            VSCODE knows how to talk to these things via model context protocol.
            google - postgress MCP server. you will find something. you can cosnsume in it diffrent options -
                docker container
                npm package
                python package
            VSCode command pallete -
                Add MCP Server -> option on how to add it
                give package name
                run it, give it DB connection url
                name it, put in user settings or workspace settings.
                i used user settings - settings.json
                hover over it, click on run option
                now in chat editor, at bottom you will see settings icon. click on it you will see query tool provided by this MC server.
                now you can use this query tool in chat like - 
                    what is schema of my database #query
                It runs a query and gives you schema of your database.
