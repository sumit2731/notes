There is contract that you need to dhere to when you are implementing equality, and that has got to do
 with hashcode.see figure 1.

just like we have isEquals method ob Object class, we have hashCode method on Object class.that method returns
 integar.so we are reducing whole state of object into those 4 bytes.


Options for calculating HasCode HasCode(figure 3)
    1)it takes memory address of object and hashes it.This is default implementation of hasCode method on Object
        class.
    2)you can generate a unique hashcode implementation by using unique member variable like id etc.you can directly
        use id as hashcode also.
    3)if such unique member variable does not exist then generate hasCode by using combination of member variables.

How to generate HashCode (figure 4)
    1)first point means if you want to use single member variable to hash.then jus use that in Objects.hasCode
    2)if you want to use multiple member variables to generate hash, then use Objects.hash

    Point ot be noted is if member variables are instance of another class, then it class hasMethod of respective classes,
    this is just like Object.equals
