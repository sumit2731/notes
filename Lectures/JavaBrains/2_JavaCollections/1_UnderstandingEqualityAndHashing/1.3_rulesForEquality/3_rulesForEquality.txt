Rules that need to follow while implementing equals contract(figure 1)
    reflexivity(figure 2)- when it could we violated this rule, when equals method
        changes state of object, it not read only operation.
    symmetry(figure 3)
    transitivity (figure 4)
    consistency (figure 5) - first 2 values were equal, then we changed one object state,
         they they were not equal, then we changed state back to original, again they are equal.
    Non-Nullity(figure 6) - why? because we called null ob object, and if object is null then we should get null pinter exception.
