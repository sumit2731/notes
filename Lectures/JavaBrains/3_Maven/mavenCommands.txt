1)mvn archetype:generate
    used while creatig a project from maven, shows all avalible archetype. you need
    to select one. see lecture 5
2)mvn compile
    compiles the maven project and generates the .class files in  target folder.

3)mvn test
    It finds all the tests, compiles them, then runs them.
    I think it also compiles the other code also.
    
4)mvn package
    compiles the project and generates the jar file in target folder.
    the jar file name is as per coordinates specified in pom.xml.
