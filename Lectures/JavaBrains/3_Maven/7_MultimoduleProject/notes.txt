30)Creating Parent and child Modules
    maven application can have multiple modules.their is specific heirarchy and strucure that you need to follow.

    first we create a default maven project.after generating it we delete everything except pom.xml.because we do
    not want this project to generate any jar, we want it to act as parent project, where all other projects will reside.
    we know that by default packaging type is jar, but here we dnt want to generate jar. we want to act it as parent.
    way to specify this as parent project is by marking the packaging as pom(instead of default jar).

    <packaging>pom</packaging>

    then we create 2 new project inside this one. maven was intelligent enough to understand that we want them to child of this.
    in parent project a new entry was added automatically for each project -

      <modules>
        <module>my-library</module>
        <module>distributable-app</module>
      </modules>

    In child project also a entry was added specifying who is parent of this -
        <parent>
            <artifactId>website</artifactId>
            <groupId>io.javabrains</groupId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </parent>


31)How multimodule projects work
    advantages -
    a)removes duplicates- these parts are inherited by child pom's from parent -
        1)dependencies
        2)build (which contains the plugin management part)
        3)properties
    b)build phases of parent and child are related, when we run build phase for parent it runs for all child.
        There is something known as reactor build order, which looks at whole project and determine order in which
        it has to execute this phase. generally this is order in which modules are listed in pom.xml
