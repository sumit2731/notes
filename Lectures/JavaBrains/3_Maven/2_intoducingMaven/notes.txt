concept of a project -

    figure 1 - primary goal of maven is not be build tool  but to me project management tool.

    figure 2 -  this is what project looks like.java does not have support for project atleast in IDE
        agnostic way.this is where maven comes into picture, it manages project by using something called
        Project object model.

Characteristics of Maven -

    Characteristics of maven - figure4,5


Setting up Maven -
    Download apache maven(binary zip archive) file is independent of OS.
    copy to some path(java folder in home directory)
    add path till bin to path variable -
        export PATH=pathToBIn:$PATH
            explanation -
                to read PATH - ECHO $PATH, it has various values separated by ':'.
                to write - export PATH=value, so in case we append our value to existing values


    Note - CHAT_GPT shows that we also need to setup the MAVEN_HOME variable, also in mac to persist chnages we need to
    add the export command to .bash_profile or .zshrc file.follow a different path
