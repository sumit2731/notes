12)declarative dependency management explained
    Without maven , you need to download jar(contents of jar- classes and libraries) and copy it to 
    your class path in order to use it.if you use maven you just need to mention all dependencies in
    pom.xml and maven will make them avalaible in your class path.

    these dependencies are artifacts of other maven projects which are identified by their coordinates
    in maven universe. see figure 1.

13)Examining the POM dependencies section
    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.junit</groupId>
                <artifactId>junit-bom</artifactId>
                <version>5.11.0</version>
                <type>pom</type>
                <scope>import</scope>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>


    groupId, artifactid and version is common, we will talk about scope later.
