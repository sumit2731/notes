5 -Layer 4 vs Layer 7 
    slide 9. at layer 4 , nginx can detect whether it is syn or TLS hello and can
        can raise events that can be helpful.

    It doesn't really look at the content and try to derive, oh, this is a get request.
    For example, at layer four proxy doesn't usually do that.It can with deep packet 
    inspection, but there is no really point to that at that point.You're just a layer
    seven reverse proxy.

    Layer 7 -
        you can see which url it is visiting(at layer 4 , you can just see IP )
        you see headers,cookies, http methods
        This stuff is encrypted , so you need to decrypt it.

    When to opt for Layer 4 proxy -
        When nginx doesnt undertand protocol like grpc,webRTC etc.
        you can opt in for a layer four proxy and say, hey, blindly just take whatever I
            give you in this packet or this segment.Just forward it to backend.

    When to use layer 7 Proxy -
        Understand and rewrite headers
        does more to content itself

    Difference in loadbalancing -
        Because we don't understand the context in layer four, it's very dangerous to start a swizzling and
        load balancing packets on the back end.It's like, hey, the moment you do a layer four load balancing
        the TCP connection is pegged to one and only one back end.You cannot share it.You cannot use another
        back end connection


        At layer 7,it udnerstand this is Http and Http is stateless.
        I'm not going to do any of that stuff.I can share my request on any of these back end 
        connection.So load balancers become more efficient in layer seven, but there is a cost 
        of decryption and the cost of sharing the certificate, which we're going to talk about 
        in lecture.
